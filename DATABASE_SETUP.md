# Database Setup Guide

This app now uses **Neon Database** for storing categories and flash cards. Neon provides 3GB of free storage, perfect for your flash card images.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create Neon Database

1. Go to [https://console.neon.tech/](https://console.neon.tech/)
2. Sign up/Login with GitHub
3. Click "Create Project"
4. Choose a name (e.g., "flashcard-app")
5. Select a region close to you
6. Click "Create Project"

### Step 2: Get Database URL

1. In your Neon dashboard, go to "Connection Details"
2. Copy the "Connection String" (it looks like: `postgresql://username:password@hostname/database`)
3. Save this URL - you'll need it in the next step

### Step 3: Set Up Database

Run one of these commands with your database URL:

```bash
# Option 1: Set environment variable
export DATABASE_URL="your_database_url_here"
node setup-database.js

# Option 2: Pass URL directly
node setup-database.js "your_database_url_here"
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
NEON_API_KEY=your_neon_api_key_here
```

### Step 5: Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```
